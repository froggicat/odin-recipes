    <p>perfectly chewy and chocolately cookies - easy to make, easy to devour ;)</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>120g butter</li>
        <li>75g light brown sugar</li>
        <li>75g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 medium egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>180g plain flour</li>
        <li>½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>150g dark chocolate</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line two baking sheets with parchment.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter and sugars together until very light and fluffy, then beat in the egg and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Once combined, stir in the flour, bicarb, chocolate and ¼ tsp salt.</li>
        <li>Scoop 10 large tbsps of the mixture onto the trays, leaving enough space between each to allow for spreading.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 mins or until firm at the edges but still soft in the middle – they will harden a little as they cool.</li>
        <li>Leave to cool on the tray for a few mins before eating warm, or transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Will keep for three days in an airtight container.</li>
        
    </ol>
